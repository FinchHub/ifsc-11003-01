        <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>
          Progressive enhancement is, in my opinion, a method of formatting web
          content from the bottom-up, prioritizing good structure and
          future-proofed framing which can be neatly built upon over time. When
          web developers focus on creating a product that works at the most
          fundamental level, it ensures accessibility no matter the
          circumstance. Clean and semantic HTML guarantees that, whether a user
          requires accessibility features or simply lacks the bandwidth, they
          can reliably access a page's content. Separating concerns, like
          keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separate, ensures that each layer
          can work independently of one another. By putting basic,
          accessibility-focused functionality first, then gradually enhancing
          the site in layers, you can create performant websites that function
          well and are aesthetically supportive to the user experience.
          Additional reading on the benefits of progressive enhancement can be

        <h3>Final Project Choice</h3>
        <p>
          For my final, I chose to rebuild one of my existing websites rather
          than build the NASA one. I originally created
          <a href="https://doxaconstruction.com">doxaconstruction.com</a> for my
          family's business, but after a server issue, we lost the first
          version. I built that website using Joomla in 2018 and had no idea
          what I was doing. The second, and currently live iteration of this
          website, is built on Wordpress. I hate using Wordpress too, so my
          side-project has been to recreate our website from scratch without a
          CMS, and I thought this project would be the perfect opportunity to at
          least get the ball rolling.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Project Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          When I started building the draft of the final project, I already had a
          vague idea on what I wanted the entire page to look like. I wanted to keep
          the website fairly similar to the original, but with a more maintainable
          format that was capable of being accessed on both web and desktop environments.
          Frankly, I don't feel like I accomplished that task, but I learned a lot during 
          this first iteration of what will inevitably be many.</p>
        <p>
          The first draft was mostly just focused on getting my handdrawn wireframe in 
          a realized format. I did that and achieved the wireframe pretty much exactly,
          so I do feel that I accomplished that. However, the color theme was extremely
          difficult for me. Unsurprisingly, it's hard to theme a website off a logo when 
          the logo's colors are black and grey. After a lot of deliberation, I wound up
          going with earthy tones since that seemed well-fitting for a construction 
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first draft was already fairly close to the finished product, but I wasn't
          happy with the way it was looking. Rather than spend time rebuilding the entire
          thing, I made a few distinct changes to try and separate the mobile and web 
          presentation. In the first draft, the hero section was just a rectangular section 
          contained within the max-width of the body. For the final draft, I turned this 
          rectangular section into the mobile version, and broke it out of the max width 
          constraints for the desktop version and presented it as a fullscreen hero.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I finished that, the final draft was spent revising the services section, 
          which I'm frankly still not at all happy with. I'm still thinking I might have 
          gone a little extra on the interactivity and gradients, but I did try to keep 
          them subtle and add mild flair as opposed to becoming eyesores throughout the 
          page. In the final draft, many more items have hover interactivity; my personal 
          favorite was the navigation, where I added a slight scale and a drawn-on underline 
          from left to right.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have two uses of JavaScript in this assignment; the contact page, and a list
          inside the footer, where I utilize a "latest projects" list that pulls "latest"
          articles from a "partials" folder inside the assets. I was reading about better
          solutions to this, like keeping a JSON file that I could also use for the "projects"
          page. I wasn't happy with the multi-page layout of the projects page, but I didn't 
          want to get too deep in the weeds because I was afraid it might have been outside 
          the scope of the project. I'm wishing I would have now, but I'll get back to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest regret was starting this website out as a full-desktop application.
          Admittedly, I lost a whole lot of vigor once I read that article on progressive 
          enhancement, because the website mentioned starting out with a simple-as-possible
          layout, and the article I read on BlueGift mentioned that applied to mobile web 
          especially. I felt that pain when I was trying to retrofit breakpoints and scaling 
          onto my existing sections, and I eventually gave up trying because I'm actually 
          hoping I can return to this project after I've taken the Mobile Web class. I
          want to redesign this website yet again, but from the ground up as a mobile-first
          application that I can later add onto.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was definitely a learning experience. I picked up a lot of extremely 
          basic HTML/CSS when I did web stuff for fun while deployed back in 2022, 
          but I only learned enough to be dangerous at overusing divs and jamming style into 
          the HTML left and right. This class was a humbling and interesting learning
          experience in just how non-accessible I was building websites out, and I'm
          really eager to come back to this because I'll likely continue to work on it 
          over the next several months as I try to get a finished product ready for my 
          family's company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll try to hit it before the final is due, but just in case I don't, I also 
          intend on remodeling the Careers page to be a little easier on the eyes and 
          have a more visual presentation, with a hero section a bit like I have it 
          on the home page. I've mostly hesitated on doing this only because I'm debating 
          whether it'd be easier to retrofit everything to mobile, or start completely 
          over and just snag bits of the original HTML/CSS to put in the media query 
          breakpoints for wide screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was an extremely enjoyable class, and I'm very excited to pick it back up 
          next semester with Mobile Web. Thanks for the terrific class, and if you have 
          any pointers for how I should actually tackle this website outside of the 
          classroom, I'd absolutely appreciate it!
