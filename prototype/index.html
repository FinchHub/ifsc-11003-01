      <section id="content">

        <p><strong>Consumer rights and anti-consumerism</strong> have become increasingly prominent topics in recent years, as individuals and advocacy groups work to challenge exploitative corporate practices and demand greater transparency. The modern consumer rights movement traces its roots back to early 20th-century labor struggles and the fight for fair business practices. Today, it encompasses a <em>wide</em> range of issues, including data privacy, environmental sustainability, ethical production, and protection against monopolistic behavior.</p>

        <p><strong>In the digital age</strong>, corporations have gained <em>unprecedented</em> influence over consumersâ€™ choices and data. High-profile cases involving deceptive advertising, invasive tracking technologies, and manipulative subscription models have sparked public debate and regulatory action. Anti-consumerist movements focus not only on protecting consumers but also on promoting mindful consumption and reducing dependence on exploitative systems.</p>

        <h2>Modern Challenges</h2>

        <p>Several pressing issues have shaped the consumer rights landscape over the past decade:</p>

<ul>
          <li>Data Privacy Violations - Companies have been caught harvesting and selling personal data without proper consent.</li>

          <li>Deceptive Patterns - User interfaces are designed to trick customers into unwanted purchases or subscriptions.</li>

          <li>Planned Obsolescence - Products are intentionally designed to fail or become outdated quickly, pushing consumers to spend more.</li>

          <li>Monopolistic Practices - Tech giants have been criticized for stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.</li>

          <li>Environmental Impact - Overproduction and unethical supply chains contribute to climate change and resource depletion.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Governments worldwide are responding with stronger regulations, including data privacy laws like the GDPR in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.</p>
