        <h2>Corporate Practices and Anti-Consumerism</h2>
        <p>Consumer protections have gradually eroded within the last two decades, with companies growing more and more confident in their ability to lock you out of devices and media that you have bought and paid for. From private companies like Flock surveilling the movements of nearly every American's vehicle on the road to companies like Volkswagen forcing subscriptions to use the full horsepower of your vehicle, private companies have felt more empowered than ever to commoditize you and leave you without the legal right to do anything about it.</p>

        <p>Consumers are left largely without legal rights thanks to terms of service that bind the consumer to jarring clauses such as forced arbitration, where the consumer signs away their seventh amendment right to be heard by a judge and jury in a public courtroom. Corporations have historically been held in favor over the consumer, being allowed unprecedented influence over consumersâ€™ choices and data. High-profile cases involving deceptive advertising, invasive tracking technologies, and manipulative subscription models have sparked public debate and regulatory action. In response, traction has grown lately towards anti-consumerist movements, which focus not only on protecting consumers but also on promoting mindful consumption and reducing dependence on exploitative systems.</p>

          <p>In recent years, both individuals an organizations have come together to spread awareness of these anti-consumerist practices, and to advocate for consumer protections. Notable figures and groups include:</p>
