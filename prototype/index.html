        <h2>Corporate Practices and Anti-Consumerism</h2>
        <p>Consumer protections have gradually eroded within the last two decades, with companies growing more and more confident in their ability to lock you out of devices and media that you have bought and paid for. From private companies like Flock surveilling the movements of nearly every American's vehicle on the road to companies like Volkswagen forcing subscriptions to use the full horsepower of your vehicle, private companies have felt more empowered than ever to commoditize you and leave you without the legal right to do anything about it.</p>

        <p>Consumers are left largely without legal rights thanks to terms of service that bind the consumer to jarring clauses such as forced arbitration, where the consumer signs away their seventh amendment right to be heard by a judge and jury in a public courtroom. Corporations have historically been held in favor over the consumer, being allowed unprecedented influence over consumersâ€™ choices and data. High-profile cases involving deceptive advertising, invasive tracking technologies, and manipulative subscription models have sparked public debate and regulatory action. In response, traction has grown lately towards anti-consumerist movements, which focus not only on protecting consumers but also on promoting mindful consumption and reducing dependence on exploitative systems.</p>

        <h3>Key and Recent Advocates</h3>
          <p>In recent years, both individuals an organizations have come together to spread awareness of these anti-consumerist practices, and to advocate for consumer protections. Notable figures and groups include:</p>

        </ul>

        
        <h3>Right to Repair</h3>
          <blockquote>We envision a world where consumers have full control over their tech where buying a product means having the full right to use, repair, modify, and understand it without interference. <cite> FULU Foundation </cite></blockquote>
          <p>Right to repair is a movement within the fight for consumer protections that focuses on ensuring that both consumers and independent repair shops have the full, legal ability to fix products they've purchased, to include the tools and parts necessary for fixing the product.</p>
        <p>In the past, when a consumer bought a product, it was understood that they <em>owned</em> that product, and could do whatever they wanted to with it. This, traditionally, was not limited to fixing that product themselves. Increasingly, however, companies have been locking down their products with <strong>digital restrictions</strong> and <strong>proprietary parts</strong>, which severely limits average owners and, sometimes, even repair shops from fixing a product. This forces the shop or individual to send the product back to the manufacturer or service provider, so that they can fix it at an inflated cost.</p>

        <h4>How Companies Restrict Repair</h4>
          <p>Over the years, manufacturers and corporations have developed and perfected tactics to prevent the repair of their product by individuals or individual repair shops. They include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Utilizing Propriety Parts</li>
          <ul>Companies manufacture and use parts in their products that are entirely inaccessible to those not a part of the initial manufacturing process. Short of buying an entirely new system, this forces the consumer or shop into sending the entire product to the original manufacturer's shop for a repair with a costly markup.</ul>
          <li>Locking Diagnostic Software</li>
          <ul>Popular among vehicle and heavy equipment manufacturers, the diagnostic software is often completely restricted from the user or locked behind extremely costly paywalls. This becomes a more pervasive issue the more electronics manufacturers add to their vehicles.</ul>
          <li>Refusing to Sell Parts</li>
          <ul>Often, manufacturers will outright refuse the sale of their proprietary parts, citing their parts to be "confidential" or refusing to advocate the repair because it is "in the consumer's best interest" for the manufacturer to repair the item for them.</ul>
          <li>DMCA and Warranty Laws</li>
          <ul>The Digital Milllennium Copyright Act has anti-circumvention laws, making it illegal to bypass the digital locks that manufacturers put in place to prevent you from servicing the product you paid for.</ul>
        </ol>
