        <p><strong>Consumer rights and anti-consumerism</strong> have become increasingly prominent topics in recent years, as individuals and advocacy groups work to challenge exploitative corporate practices and demand greater transparency. The modern consumer rights movement traces its roots back to early 20th-century labor struggles and the fight for fair business practices. Today, it encompasses a <em>wide</em> range of issues, including data privacy, environmental sustainability, ethical production, and protection against monopolistic behavior.</p>

        <p><strong>In the digital age</strong>, corporations have gained <em>unprecedented</em> influence over consumers’ choices and data. High-profile cases involving deceptive advertising, invasive tracking technologies, and manipulative subscription models have sparked public debate and regulatory action. Anti-consumerist movements focus not only on protecting consumers but also on promoting mindful consumption and reducing dependence on exploitative systems.</p>

        <h2>Modern Challenges</h2>
